						<h3>Friday 23rd May 2025</h3>
						<br>
                        <p>First off welcome too the NeonVoid game devlog. Secondly, this log entry will be an introductory log for the idea, and plan of action regarding this game.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>The Idea</h2>
						<p>The idea is an Android and IOS, sci-fi runner game similar to Subway Surfer, Temple Run and Minion Rush mobile titles. </p>
                        <p>The player will be a spacecraft traversing through a neon city environment.</p>
                        <p>This project will be a solo project, and will heavily rely on already made assets by 3rd party creators. I will give credit where credit is due. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Later down the line though, I may convert the assets used within the game to be custom assets made by me or perhaps by a skilled artist, but until then it will be pre-made assets. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>The Plan of Action</h2>
                        <p>For this project, I will begin with creating the player features, and movement, then the terrain will be my next target.
                            Every Friday I will release a devlog and video log. Devlogs will be posted here, and videologs will be posted on the Wi.Bi Studios YouTube channel, so stay tuned for that. 
                            I will also include gifs, pngs and jpegs for the written logs, so that it's not just words as I'm aware that would be boring and possibly deter people from reading. 
                        </p>

						<h2>Expanding the Website & New Projects in the Works!</h2>
						<p>Hey everyone, welcome back to another Behind the Code dev blog update!
							I’ve been making steady progress both on my website and behind the scenes
							on the game projects. Here’s a rundown of what’s new and what’s coming next!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Website Updates: More Games Added!</h2>
						<p>I’ve now added all of my game projects to the site — well, almost all of them!
							There are still one or two missing, but don’t worry, they’ll be added soon.
							Right now, only a few of the game pages have all the relevant details, but
							I'm actively working on filling them out with descriptions, screenshots,
							and other key information. We aim to have all these pages adjusted by end of 
							next week, Friday 4th April 2025.</p> <br>
						<p>The goal is to make the website a true hub for my work, where you can easily
							follow along with my progress and get a closer look at each of my projects.
							So keep an eye out for updates as we continue fleshing out these pages!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>A New Mobile Game is in the Works</h2>
						<p>In addition to my main projects, I've also started cooking up a small mobile game!
							It’s still in the early stages, so there’s nothing available just yet, but I'm
							excited to experiment with something more compact and accessible. More details
							will be coming soon as development progresses, so stay tuned!</p>
						<br>
						<p>That’s all for now — thanks for following along with my journey, and I’ll see you in the next update!</p>
						<p>- Liam Wilson</p>

						<br>
                        <h2>Well come to "Behind the Code"!</h2>
						<p>Hey everyone, and welcome to the first official post on my game development
                            blog! I'm super excited to share my journey with you as I build games,
                            tackling challenges, and creating awesome experiences. This blog will serve as a hub
                            for updates, behind-the-scenes looks, and insights into my development and learning processes.
                            Let’s dive in!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Building the Portfolio Website</h2>
                        <p>One of the first steps in making my game development journey more official was creating
                            this website. I wanted a space where I could share my progress, provide updates, and
                            showcase my work to the you, and the community. It took some time to get everything set up, 
                            but I'm happy with how it’s coming along. Expect more improvements and features in the future,
                            including dedicated sections for my projects, dev logs, and possibly even a forum for
                            discussion!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Game Development Focus</h2>
                        <p>Currently, my primary focus is on increasing my knowledge with engines such as Unity & Unreal, 
                            I plan to delve into C# and C++ programming languages, and I'm excited to see where this journey
                            takes me. I have a few game ideas in mind, and I can't wait to start working on them. I'll be sure
                            to keep you updated on my progress, so stay tuned!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Other Development Plans</h2>
                        <p>Whils my main focus is creating new content to learn and improve upon my craft. I will along the side be
                            going back to older projects and updating them to be more polished and professional. I have a few ideas
                            in mind for some of my older projects, and I can't wait to see how they turn out. I'll be sure to keep you
                            updated on my progress, so stay tuned!</p>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Join Me on This Adventure</h2>
                        <p>If you’re interested in game development, I’d love for you to follow along! I’ll be sharing updates,
                            behind-the-scenes details, and maybe even some sneak peeks at upcoming features. Stay tuned for more
                            dev logs, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about game dev.
                            <br> Thanks for being here, and I’ll see you in the next post!
                            <br> - Liam Wilson</p>
