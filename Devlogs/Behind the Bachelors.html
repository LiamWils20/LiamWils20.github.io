                        <h2>Programming Cons</h2>
                        <p>My least favorite part of of programming thus far is and most likely always will be Syntax errors
                            and debugging. I find syntax to be annoying because the smallest type can break the entire game, 
                            then trying to debug the error afterwards is a nightmare. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Improvements</h2>
                        <p>I feel I have improved since last week by doing today's coding task, as I have learned something 
                            as last week I had little to no knowledge of C# and Unity. I am excited to learn more about C# 
                            and Unity as the course progresses.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Errors of the day</h2>
                        <p>Today, in my code. I made a slight typo which caused a big issue. This typo was fixed by taking a
                            few minutes to read through the code thoroughly which had the typo and triple check it with the
                            perfected code (code displayed in class). I fixed the typo by swapping 2 or 3 characters around
                            which I had misplaced or accidentally typed. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Overall, I didn't struggle besides with a few typos which were quickly snuffed out and remedied. 
                            I learned how to create a basic movement system into a game and I learned the basics of an if statement.
