                        <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
                        <p>Hey everyone, here is an update on my master's programme. 
                            Today, I met with my learning supervisor for the course, and we had a nice lengthy discussion regarding my 
                            project and the programme aswell. He gave me a lot of great advice and pointers regarding the project. Even a base
                            concept for the game which is easier and even better than my original plan. </p>
                        <h2>The OG</h2>
                        <p>So, I will explain what the orginal idea was before explaining the new. The orginal idea is simple, it was
                            meant to be a survival game with building, fighting and surviving the enviroment. It was to be built within
                            Unreal Engine. However plans have changed. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Brand-New</h2>
                        <p>Onto the good stuff. The brand, new, cooler project is a fantasy style, story-rich game which utlises a slow-time
                            feature, presenting players with the perfect opportunty to take control of the scene and control their foes in this
                            lovely story about a son on a quest for revenge and redemption. </p>
                        <p>This project is planned to be made within Unity Engine instead of Unreal, as I'm more familiar with Unity
                            and so it'd be easier to create the project in the short amount of time given. With this new project in mind
                            I do need to find a new research question for my master's written element. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Team</h2>
                        <p>This is a university project, however we do have the start of a small team. It's me, as the programmer and game
                            designer. Then we have Tristan (my cousin) also know as TJ, as the 2D/3D artist, and another Game Designer. </p>
                        <h2>The Progress so far</h2>
                        <p>So far, I have managed to get a simple movement script up and running, with WASD and Jump mechanics. I've also
                            managed to create the slow-time mechanic which works great. Just need to add more to the game to get enemies
                            and players working together.</p>
                        <p>I think next development session, I may try and implement an attacking system, enemies and perhaps a tutorial 
                            system</p>
                        <p>And now on to TJ's work. He started working on a house building's exterior for one of the levels. All he
                            has left todo is the roof and finer details on the exterior. </p>
                        <img class="log-image" src="../images/Devlogs/Behind the Master's/Entry 2 - TJ House.png" alt="An image of the house so far">
                        <p>Next development session, TJ will be finishing the house and if there is more time he'll move onto working
                            with one of the characters. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>So, overall development is off to a great start. A few key features implemented, and the modelling of to 
                            as splendid start as well. I'm excited for this game to be ready for viewing. 
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>My Plans</h2>
                        <p>Now let's quickly highlight my plans for the end goal of this course.</p>
                        <p>For the end of this course I aim to craft and construction a survival game within Unreal Engine. 
                            I have chosen the unreal engine because I am not familiar with it in the slightest and I want to 
                            expand my knowledge of game engines. Before this course I began a self study regarding Godot and learning
                            the basics of that. And so for this course I wish to study Unreal engine and hopefully grasp how to craft
                            games through this powerful tool. </p>
                        <p>I plan to create a 3D survival game within unreal to be played on many platforms so that I can observe and study
                            what the people enjoy about each platform or if people enjoy survival games on certain platforms more than others.
                            I have a question which I will be aiming to ask but before I reveal it here, I need to make it more direct and focused on
                            a particluar study. 
                        </p>
