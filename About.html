	<h3>My Journey</h3>
	<br>
	<div class="blue-divider"></div> <br>
	<p>My journey began in the year 2018 when I completed my studies at secondary school and went on to learn computer sciecen,
		not knowing exactly what I wanted to do. All I knew was that it'd involve computers, so a course in computer science 
		would be a good choice. Allowing me to bide my time until I figured out what I wanted to do. </p>
	<br>
	<p>In 2021, I finalised my studies for the computer science course, and I began working in the June of 2021 as a Laboratory
		Technician. Only because I needed employment, and my dad needed staff so the opportunity arose and I took it. For the 
		next year, until August of 2022 I worked Full-Time as a Laboratory Technician. Gaining money, equipment and a small 
		piece of experience in the working world. </p>
	<br>
	<p>During my employment, I was still deciding what I wanted to become. I initially thought I'd go on to study Aerospace
		Engineering. However, I didn't as it would had been Â£9,000 each year, for four years. Which in my eyes, was a lot of money
		to learn something I wasn't sure I'd enjoy. And then I was like "Sod It", I'll go and study more on Games Programming and 
		Development. Which is what I did for the next two years. </p>
	<br>
	<p>That then brings us to 2024, where I completed the Bachelors degree and got awarded the relevant certificate. And now, I'm 
		looking for programming work, whilst working on some indie titles.
