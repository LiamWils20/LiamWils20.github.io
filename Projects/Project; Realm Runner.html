<!-- Baseline -->
	<h2 id="Baseline">Baseline</h2> 
	<p>This project was made as a university project within a 13 week time frame. 
        We were given teams to work amongst, and was tasked with the creation of a game,
        which was based on either Super Mario 64, or Crash Bandicoot. Our team chose 
        Super Mario 64. </p>

<!-- About Section -->
	<h2 id="About">About</h2>
	<p>Realm Runner is a platforming-action-puzzle adventure where <br> 
	you will explore different dimension to retrieve lost fragments, <br>
	the source of life in this universe. Hurry! You must save this <br> 
	reality from the threat lurking within the dark.</p>
	<br>
    <p>Traverse your way through different realms of the universe, <br> 
	using your skills of platforming, solving puzzles and defeating <br> 
	enemies. Doing all this whilst collecting coins and fragments to <br> 
	progress through the realms right up until the final boss</p>

	<h2 id="Outline">Contribution Outline</h2>
	<p>This section is a brief outline of my duties regarding this project,

<!-- #region UI Programming -->
	<h2 id="UI">My Duty; UI Programmer</h2>
	<p>This section is a detailed explanation of what I did as the UI programmer, 
		on this project. At the end, there will be a section of things I did which 
		got cut or postponed due to scope and time remaining. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Menus</h2>
	<p>My first obligation for this project was creating the main menu. Everything regarding the Main Menu
		went into one singular script, which I no longer do but it's what I did at the time of this project. 
		For every button I had on the main menu, I created a function, each funtion then ran the buttons specific needs
		for example, the "Start Game" button, had the code line "Scene.Manager.LoadScene("HubLevelWithAssets");". 
		Each button had their own unique funtion, I won't go through them all as most are self explanatory.
