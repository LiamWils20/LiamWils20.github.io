	<h3>My Contributions, in detail</h3> <br>
    <h2>Baseline</h2> 
	<p>This project was made as a university project within a 13 week time frame. 
        We were given teams to work amongst, and was tasked with the creation of a game,
        which was based on either Super Mario 64, or Crash Bandicoot. Our team chose 
        Super Mario 64.
