						<h2>New Projects</h2>
                        <p>It's been a while since I have posted a blog update, for this I do apologise. </p>
                        <p>I have begun working on some website based projects, a couple of them are done in terms of basic functionality others require more work.</p>
                        <p>The next few titles will be of these new projects, what they are, why I decided to make em.</p>
                        <p>VoidTimer, <a href="https://voidtimer.github.io/VoidTimer">Link</a>, is a countdown based website for those who wish to countdown to a special event i.e. a holiday, but you don't wish to actually countdown. </p>
                        <p>GeoBlade, <a href="https://voidtimer.github.io/VoidTimer">Link</a>, is a simple virtual table-top, designed for online tabletop role-playing games (RPGs). It allows users to upload and play their own maps, with future plans to add features such as dice rolling, character sheets, and other tools to enhance the gaming experience.</p>
                        <p>MysteryBox, <a href="https://mysteryboxminigame.github.io">Link</a>, is a unique platform that offers a variety of mystery box experiences for users. Each box contains a curated selection of items based on user preferences, making it a fun and personalized surprise.</p>
                    
                        <h2>Current Progress</h2>
                        <p>Currently I am working on a project called M.A.R.V.I.S, you may have heard it in one of the previous entries. 
                            We have made some progress in terms of player control and visuals.. But there is still a lot of work to be done before it is ready for release.</p>

						<p>You might have noticed that it has been a few weeks since my last post and that is because 
							I have been busy working on my new project, updating the website layout, and design.</p>
							
						<h2>This Website!</h2> 
						<p>First, let's discuss this website. I have managed to figure out how to get a cartoon / animated style for a logo,
							and backdrop. Because I have zero artistic ability I had to use
							<a target="_blank" href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a> to convert a selfie style image of mine, into a cartoon
							/ animated style. It did take a few tries to get it just right. In the end though, I got what I was looking for.</p>
							
						<p>I also, added a page for my new project. It isn't finished nor released. I've only just begun, but figured I would 
							create the page on this <a href="Projects/Project; NeonVoid.html">website</a>.</p>
							
						<p>I have also just finished updating all of my game pages, so that they contain the correct information, screenshots
							and have the same layout because they didn't and I want all game pages to posses the same layout. So that when
							people view them they know what to expect and where to find the relevant information they are looking for.</p>

							<p>Hey everyone, welcome back to another Behind the Code dev blog update!
							I’ve been making steady progress both on my website and behind the scenes
							on the game projects. Here’s a rundown of what’s new and what’s coming next!</p>
						<br>
						<h2>Website Updates: More Games Added!</h2>
						<p>I’ve now added all of my game projects to the site — well, almost all of them!
							There are still one or two missing, but don’t worry, they’ll be added soon.
							Right now, only a few of the game pages have all the relevant details, but
							I'm actively working on filling them out with descriptions, screenshots,
							and other key information. We aim to have all these pages adjusted by end of 
							next week, Friday 4th April 2025.</p> <br>
						<p>The goal is to make the website a true hub for my work, where you can easily
							follow along with my progress and get a closer look at each of my projects.
							So keep an eye out for updates as we continue fleshing out these pages!</p>

						<p>Hey everyone, and welcome to the first official post on my game development
                            blog! I'm super excited to share my journey with you as I build games,
                            tackling challenges, and creating awesome experiences. This blog will serve as a hub
                            for updates, behind-the-scenes looks, and insights into my development and learning processes.
                            Let’s dive in!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Building the Portfolio Website</h2>
                        <p>One of the first steps in making my game development journey more official was creating
                            this website. I wanted a space where I could share my progress, provide updates, and
                            showcase my work to the you, and the community. It took some time to get everything set up, 
                            but I'm happy with how it’s coming along. Expect more improvements and features in the future,
                            including dedicated sections for my projects, dev logs, and possibly even a forum for
                            discussion!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Game Development Focus</h2>
                        <p>Currently, my primary focus is on increasing my knowledge with engines such as Unity & Unreal, 
                            I plan to delve into C# and C++ programming languages, and I'm excited to see where this journey
                            takes me. I have a few game ideas in mind, and I can't wait to start working on them. I'll be sure
                            to keep you updated on my progress, so stay tuned!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Other Development Plans</h2>
                        <p>Whils my main focus is creating new content to learn and improve upon my craft. I will along the side be
                            going back to older projects and updating them to be more polished and professional. I have a few ideas
                            in mind for some of my older projects, and I can't wait to see how they turn out. I'll be sure to keep you
                            updated on my progress, so stay tuned!</p>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Join Me on This Adventure</h2>
                        <p>If you’re interested in game development, I’d love for you to follow along! I’ll be sharing updates,
                            behind-the-scenes details, and maybe even some sneak peeks at upcoming features. Stay tuned for more
                            dev logs, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about game dev.
                            <br> Thanks for being here, and I’ll see you in the next post!
