                    <h2>What Happened End of Week 2?</h2>
                    <p>So, last week ended with the second class of my studies, the webinar covered an assignment overview and project planning.
                        My project is essentially planned and ready for development. Which I technically started 2 weeks ago. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>What Happened on Week 3?</h2>
                    <p>I have realised recently that time does fly, one moment you're just starting the course, and in the next instant you're 
                        already three weeks in. This week was a bit uncertain. The webinar on Wednesday went over theoretical perspectives and methodologies.
                        As soon as the recording goes live I will re-watch it and begin exploring potential research methodologies for my paper. I need to figure this out
                        before end of week 4, as it may require me to add some data collection features within my project. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Also this week I have begun writing my Abstract as well as a gantt chart to help stay focused and on track for this module. 
                        I should have my Abstract done and written by the end of Monday next week, the gantt chart should be done by end of today. 
                        Then on Monday, or when the abstract is done, I will be able to move onto the next task which to my knowledge is the presentation. 
                    </p>
